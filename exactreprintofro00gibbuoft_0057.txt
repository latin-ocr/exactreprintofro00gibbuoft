qui faciunt ad pietatem: hodieq3 nescio quae librorfl
portenta, Bne. Putherbeus‚ p. 145, thinks that it is not
safe for every one to read bad books, but only for those
who are given power to tread on serpe-nts and scorpions:
and in p. 238, we are informed, that the censures of the
Parisian Theologians made many read those condemned
writi s, which they might otherwise have neglected.1
Wi out farther delay, we must enter upon the his-
tory of t'he Index Expurgatorius‚ published by the
Master of the Sacred ·Palace,¹²¹ Romae, Ex Typographia

which I have procured a 'reprint of, and Ι trust it will
be found that I have endeavoured to make it resemble
the original as much as possible in all respects.0

⁰ Ha'ving got a good deal of type cast on purpose for it, and tried
to imitate the numerous σφάλμαται but in my copy of the book,
the letters are so indistinct‚ that I have often found it difficult to
determine what was to be printed. The Bibliotheca Pati-um, re-
formed hythe command of the Index, will assist us in correcting
the inaccuracies of the most valuable part of the work. The word
‘cultoris in page 130, is rightly made cultioris, in Bibl. Pat. Toni. lv.
col. 535. Paris. MDCX. In p. 177, the wordfuerit is appointed to
be changed into furit ,· but alas, nou semper tendit arcum Apollo-
in p. 219, the Index itself requires the same alteration. Vide B. P.
