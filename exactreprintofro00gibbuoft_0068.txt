By the rules of the Tridentine Index, there is a good
deal of liberty allowed to Bishops, and general Inquisi-
tors. A section in the tenth gives them power, when
they think it expedient in the Kingdom‚ Province, or
Diocese, to which they belong, to prohibit books, the
use of which seems to be permitted ; and by the sixth
they are authorized to favour the circulation of the
amended works of Catholics, which had been prohi-
bited before correction : but as of course their privi-
leges were confined within certain limits, and as it was
here declared, that the sentence of excommunication
was ipso facto incurred by any person, who should read
or possess the writings of a forbidden author, nothing
remained for the Spaniards,³ whose favourites were
often condemned at Rome, but to weaken the influence,
and disregard the decrees of the Congregation of the
Index. Of this Raynaud says very justly ε in contemp-
tionem Pontificioe autoritatis, qua huiusmodi Censores
constituti sunt male vertitur.t

The case of J oannes Baptista Poza will furnish ns
with perhaps the most memorable instance of the hos-
tility that existed between the Spanish and Roman Cen-
sors. His Elvcidarivm Deiparae was published at
Complutum in 1626, fol„ and was reprinted at Lyons
in 1627, Superiorum permissm in 43 but it was pro-
scribed at Rome, die 11. Ap.u 1628. All the vzjorks of
