our early Divines were not afraid to let their contro-

’ᾗ versies be decided by the voice of the primitive Church,
. nor did they think it a disparagement to the Scriptures,

Catholike Fathers‚ in the points that I haue spoken of,
are yours, ye'shall see the siege raised, ye shall see your
aduersaries discomfeited, and put to fiight;” and none

weap0n of Antiqusty, and drive them out of the strong
Fort of Fathers, and ancient Writers, which they have
