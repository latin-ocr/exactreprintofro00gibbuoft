xiv ’ Preface.

& Imperiale Edictum comburi faciatis : and if they
neglect to punish offending Printers, divine,'and terrible
vengeance is denounced against them, from which,
etiamsi alioquin Christianissimi, they shall not escape.
The marginal notes upon this ordinance were written
by Luther‚ of whose edition I have a copy: they are
humorous‚ and very satirical.⁹

Some notice should be taken of the Bull in C'oena
Domini, because of its intimate connexion with the In-
dexes of prohibited books.

In different parts of his Bullarium, Cherubin refers
to the account he has givenq of this annual Anathema,r
Tom. III. p. 183; in which place mention is 'made of
all the Bulls of this kind, ex quibus pro· temporum con-
ditione, Romanos Pontifices aliquid immutasse cognos-
catur : and the rest are with reason omitted. The Con-
stitution of Urban V., which is here cited as the first
apparently belonging to this class, is certainly very un-
worthy of the name ; for it was published in the month
'of October, and not on Maunday-Thursday. There is
an Ordinance of Nicholas ΙΙΙ., anno 1280, which has
much more relation to what we are seeking for. §- 19:
Item firmiter inhibemus, ne cui uamlaicae personae li·
ceat publice vel priuatim de fliie Catholica disputare, '
qui vero „contra fecerit, excommunicationis laqueo in-
nodetur.s This doubtless is the sentence inserted al‘-
most verbatim in the Simila Book of Decretals, made
