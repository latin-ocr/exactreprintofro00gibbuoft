-siue aliis, publicis, uel privatis locis tenere quoquo
modo presumant. After this, it is directed, that these
· ¹writings should be diligently sought for, and publickly
burned, under the penalties before laid down 3 and
other works of Luther, though not containing his errors,

⁴their doctrines heretical,—and observe there is a great difference
between the two.”
