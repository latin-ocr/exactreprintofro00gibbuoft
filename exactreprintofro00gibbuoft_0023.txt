{first date in the title-page of Vergerio's Italian book,

mentioned by Peignot 3b so that MDXLVIII.‚ should
be MDXLVIIII. But the figures 48 used by Vergerio‚

fin his notes to the Postremus catalogus, 1560, seem at
first sight rather unmanageable ; and they have surely

been the guide of Gretser‚⁶ and Raynaud,‘¹ and have also

been followed in a defence of Poza.e Until a better
⁴‚remedy is proposed, we may probably be satisfied with
γ remembering, that three parts of the figure 8 make the

old figure 9 when written3 so that though Vergerio
wrote 49, this mistake, as well as the former one,

Ι, might have easily occurred: and we need not go far for

zan-instance of ‘almost a similar misprint. In the title-

, page of Vergerio's treatise De Idolo Lam-etano, 1554,
„aquotation from Scripture is thus marked 3 Matth. 25? ;

ι .that is, of course, 24: but in the edition of 1556, it is

erroneously, Matth⁴ 29.

Mr. Mendham‚ merely from an oversight, (which it
is sometimes almost impossible to avoid upon these sub-
jeets‚) mistakes in saying, Lz't. Pol„ p. 26, that Vergerio
asserts, that the Index of 1549 was written by the com-
mand of Paul 1V.,f for he was not elected Po e until
1555. Marchand‚ p. 163, cites Vergerio thus: onmes
‘CAsA Arekiepz'scwus Beneventanus, in tota V ene-
torum ditione PAum ΙΙΙ. Papae Leqatus, consempsm·
mus mmm-ro anmu CATALOGUM‚ &c.; and in the
margin says: apud Wolfii Lect. Mem. tom. II. p. 692.f
But the words mus MANDATO are here falsely attributed

.' ⁴to Vergerio3 (Vide Annot. in Gazae„ fol. 249.) so that

inaccuraey prevails in the whole statement. viiOffius’
