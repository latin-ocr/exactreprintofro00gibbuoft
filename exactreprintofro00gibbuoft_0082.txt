lxxvi Preface.

They who do not, when the ancients “are alledged,
fly presently back, and reject ,their Authority ’Ἰ and
who believe, ‘⁴ that there is not one considerable point
in controversie between us and the Romanists‚ but if
Judgment were to be given by any impartial person
from the Fathers (excepting those who are ewdently
demonstrated to be spurious Authors) their mouths
- would presently be sto ed and their cause andconfi-
dence laid in the dust‚” —remembering that since, by
the confession of Bella1·min‚¹ the primitive Christian
writers non sunt regulae, nec habent auctoritatem obli-
gandi, and therefore need not be treated with extrava-
gant veneration,—will not think it incredible that Bishop
Jewel had cause to ask concerning our oppenents‚ “ Is
their Rending, Suppressing, Maiming and Burning the
Writings of the ancient Faffiers, an Argument of their
Beliance on Antiquity.’'m

Bossuet lays down as an incontestable principle, que
quelque honneur que rende l'Eglise aux saints cano-
nises‚ c'est toujours une fausse tegle, qu'on n'oseroit
condamner ce qu'on trouve dans leurs cerus-‘¹ Ius hoc
semper & est, & fuit, & erit penes Ecclesiam, vt quae
gregi detrimentum adferunt, sollicite amoliatur. Et
si integrum librum proscribere fas est, fas etiam erit

proscribere
