The words, nisi id sit Ignatio male aliunde adiectum, &c.‚ are
appointed by the Belgic Index Expurg., (Vide p. 68. ed. Lugd.

forgeries. He was extracting a sentence from St. Augustin‚ De
doct. Christ„ lib. 2. cap. 8., which is this: In canonicis autem Scrip-
tnris Ecclesiarum catholicarum quampiurium auctoritatem sequatur,
inter quas sane 111ae sint, quse Apostolicas Sedes habere δι Epistulas
accipere meruerunt. (Tom. 111. col. 18. Ant. MDCC.) Gratian alters
these words a little, and adds of his own, AB EA (namely the Apos-
tolic See) AL113 and then the Rubric pompously declares, Inter
canonicas Scripturas decretales epistolae connumerantur! (Vide
Svtcliffe, Of diuers salsities, p. 115„ in his Challenge, Lond. 1602.)

 

. The readers of the new Benedictine edition, Paris, MDCCCXXXVI„
ν are not directed to Gratiam by the usual reference in the margin3

which is in the old editions of Paris, MDchxx., apd Antwerp,
MDCC., and is as early as the impression at Basil, circ. 1506.
