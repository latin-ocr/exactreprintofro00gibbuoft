MDccxlv. Toplady says rather contemptuously ε “ Some excel-
lent things are, indeed, interspersed in their wrhings: but the golden
grains are almost lost amidst an infinity of rubbish.'’ (Meditations,
p. 125. Dub. 1831.) 1 am sorry to find that Mr. M‘Ghee imagines,
· that references to Councils‚ and Fathers‚ only give rise to “absurd
and hopeless questions ;’' and that “ in the use of these weapons.
with which alone their Ckurclz can be defended, several of the Roman
Catholic Priests, men of learning, and genius, and ability, are per·
fectly competent to meet any of the most able opponents, who could
be arrayed in discussion against them.” (Truth and Error contraseed,
p. 279. Dub. 1830. Vide Address to R. C'.. pp. xxix-xxx.) Mr.
Finch·dec1ares it to be his purpose, “to sink the Fathers ;'' whose
works “present us with a chaotic confusion, which render-s all the
efforts of the controversialist‚ who is so ignorant or so papistical as
to appeal to them in support of his doctrines, perfectly nugatory.”
(Sketch qf the Romish Controversy, Preface, pp. iv-v. Lond.1831.)
Mr. Maurice, with a first-rate neoteric spirit, considers the Fathers
as “little deserving our notice on points of doctrine,'' and thinks
that “they may be made to say any thing we please.'' (17oe
Popery qf Oxsord Ι p. 62. Lond. 1837.) These are the prevailing
notions of modern times; and it ought not to reeommend them
to us, to know, that Socinians make use ot* similar language.
Smalcius says: Totius mundi (praeter Apostolos) authoritas in
religione nulla est.‘ (Refut. 2. lib. Smiglecii, de error. nov. Arian-
vide Barlow’s Directions, p. 21.) lt is easy to understand why
Gibhon constantly sneers at the early Christian writer-eu and also
what reason the author of the Second Travela qs an Iri-rh Gen·
ileman had, sor expressinghimself, “ with little respect for the judg-
rnent and knowledge ot* those pretended vehicles of tradition, the
rathen? (vol. 1. p. 152. Dub. 1833.) The best antidoze against
such opinions, as far as they relate to Popery, may be found in the
challenge of the illustrious Jewel‚0 who selects twenty-seven din-
puted points, and declares, that “it any man aliue were able ‘to
proue any of these articles, by any one cleere or plaine clause or
sentence either of the Scriptures, or of the old nactam, or of any
