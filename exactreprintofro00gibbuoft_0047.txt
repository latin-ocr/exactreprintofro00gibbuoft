Β Francis Moncaeius published at Atrebatium, in the year 1606, a
book entitled, Aaron purgatus,⁸ and prefixed to it a dedication to
Pope Paul V„ as he tells him, with the greatest propriety, because
the chief Pontiff must necessarily be interested about his predecessor.
The volume appeared with the approbation of Joan. Buchoerus,
Paris. Theoi. δι Canon. Tornac., and of Paul Bovdot, Acad. Paris.
Theol.; librorum Censor, διο. : but three years afterwards, the Pope,
whose favour was sought for by this defenee of his cause, had the
book prohibited ς· and this sentence was renewed by Alexander
vu„ in whose Index it is the first condemned. The author, know-
ing very well, that the Christian Church is in many respects aconti-
nuation of the Jewish; but at the same time connecting without rea-
son the office of Aaron with that of the Pope, endeavours most inge-
niously in this work to free the former from idolatry, in order to
prevent Prooestants from making any use of·the comparison. It is
probab1e† that Moncaeius would have been treated better, but that a
more simple mode of getting rid of the difficulty had been a few
years before discovered by Gretser, who, in the Colloquy at Ratisbon‚‡
answered Heilbrunner thus: Aaron non fuit superior Moyse, quia
Moyses habuit ante Aaronem sacerdotium, ideo respectu summi sa·-
cerdotij, nihil fuit peccatum simpliciter, quia Moyses non peccauit.
