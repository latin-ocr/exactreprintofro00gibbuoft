>and to distil the weeds of Christian antiquity,'’ has been supposed to -
have altered his opinion when he advanced in life. (Vide Scriveneri
Praef. ad Apol. pro S. Ecce. Pat. Lond. 1672.) Let the person who
wishes to believe his consistency, compare the following passages from ¹
pp. 296,⁷, of the above named treatise, viz. Mais ceuxci, ce me
semble, iustificat suffisamment le doute que i'ai qu'il ne saille pas
receuoir comme certainement veritables, tous les tesmoignages qu’ils
tendent de la foi⁴ tenue en l’Eglise de leurs temps. . . .11 est aise a
snit que tels tesmoignages des Peres ne nous peuuent de gueres
seruit notis representans des sentimens qui ne sont pas asseurement
veritables ς qui par consequent ont besoin d’estre examinet δι
prouuez, bien loin d’asseurer dc de prouuer les nostres,—with what
he wrote about thirty years afterwards in his Repliqve aaz dev-i:

Cat. B. ⁴12, pp. 61-62.) In Daille's book De cvlt. relig. Latin„
θεώ ΜΒΟΒΧΧΙ., there is a Catalogue of his writings, and his work
upon the Fathers is said to have appeared, Anglice, per 'rhomam
suaith, Lond. 1651. : but this is a mistake3 for T. S., in his pre-
ἧσε tells us, that it was ‘¹ faithfully translated by a judicious hand.''
Α render who was used to Mettayer’s Latin edition, Gen. MDCLVI„
might fancy that the translator into English had sometimes forgotten
his faithficlnese, and exercised hisjudgment ,· for in the Latin, p. 5,
there is an entire page, which is not in the English, Lond.
RDGLXXV.. p. 6 ε at p. 87, there are two pages wanted in Eng.,
