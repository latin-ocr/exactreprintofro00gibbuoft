wanting in the pretension: but, instead of revering
anti uity‚ she has idolized herself. The Church of
Engsland, alone, has adopted a middle course3 moving
in the ‘same delightful path, and treading in the same
hallowed footsteps, with Vincentius, and the Catholic
Bishops, and the ancient Fathers : proceeding as far as
they proceeded, and stopping where they stopped.’' .
“ No well-taught member of that Church needs hesi-
tate or tremble. His path is plain. ⁷ It is not, merely,
his own judgment ; it is not, by any means, the dictato-

that “ tho’ this doctrine of the sufficiency of the Scriptures be geno-¹

on all occasions, to join the authority of the primitive Church, to that
