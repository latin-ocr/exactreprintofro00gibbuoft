Erasmus, after having been placed in the second class

'palme Sutcliffe writes thus: “And now of late one Alphonsus of
¹ rtet, ι lebusioe, hath set out 80 Canons of that Councell, translated,
ὺδεέειίὡ, out ofAraIn'cke. He might haue done well to have said,

haue ‘beleeued them, then gone to Chius, to search or
‘fiamine the ttuth of Alphonsus his report.” (Ofdiuerssalsities,
